 Priority

 This field determines if each pager address has Priority Override or not.

 When an address has Priority Override, an incoming page will always alert
 audibly ( even if the pager is in the 'MEM-O-LERT' (silent) mode). It will 
 also override Continue Read.  Thus, any function being performed when a
 Priority page is received will be interrupted.  Priority Override can be
 selected on any of the pager's addresses.
