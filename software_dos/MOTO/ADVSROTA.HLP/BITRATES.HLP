 Bit Rate

 This is the baud rate or bits per second at which the communications
 port will be communicating. Valid speeds are 110, 150, 300, 600,
 1200, 2400, 4800 and 9600.

 If communicating through a modem, you must set this value to match the
 operating speed of the modem. Check the instruction manual which was
 supplied with your modem for bit rate settings.
