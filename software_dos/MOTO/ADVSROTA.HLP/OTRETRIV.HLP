 RETRIEVE a stored pager OTA archive file from disk

 The Retrieve a Stored OTA File screen allows you to enter the file name
 of a pager archive file you have previously saved to the disk. The file
 needs to be stored at the same directory as the OTA program located. You
 don't need to enter the '.' for the file extension when entering the file
 name. For example: 

     The name shown in DOS directory  :  SAMPLETE.ST
     The name entered                 :  SAMPLETEST
