 Reminder Chirp

 When this option is selected and there is an unread message in the pager,
 the pager will generate a chirp (if the pager is in audible mode), chirp
 and vibrate (if the pager is in chirp-in-silent mode), or just vibrate 
 (if the pager is in silent mode) every two minutes to remind the user
 to read the unread message/messages.  

 NOTE:  This option does not apply to mail drop messages.
