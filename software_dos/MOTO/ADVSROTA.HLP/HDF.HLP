 History Dump File

 The history dump file (HDF) serves as a "garbage can" to hold messages
 which would normally be deleted to make room for an incoming message.
 Thus, the user has access to more than 20 personal messages.

 The HDF will appear in the 19th message slot on line 2 of the display.
