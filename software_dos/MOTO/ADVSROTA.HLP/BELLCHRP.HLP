 Bell Character Chirp

 When a bell character is received by the pager in the first block of the
 message, the pager will chirp.  Up to eight bell characters can be sent
 to the pager to get up to eight chirps.  The chirp sound will be the
 same as the chirp used in the Reminder Chirp options.  A POCSAG chirp
 is the "BEL" character ($07).  A GSC chirp is a shift followed by a 6
 combination ($3F, $16 GSC code).
