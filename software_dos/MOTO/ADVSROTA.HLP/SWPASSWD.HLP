 Software Password

 To protect your ADVISOR Alphanumeric Programming Software from
 unauthorized use, you may put password protection on the software.
 Just as you selected to use password protection while running the SETUP
 program, you can now remove the need for a password to run this program
 or you can change the password to something new. If you leave this area
 blank, you will not need to enter a password to execute this program.
 Be sure to save the new configuration before exiting.
