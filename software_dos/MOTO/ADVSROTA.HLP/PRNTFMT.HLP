 Printer Format

 Messages sent to the printer can be formatted for either 20, 40,
 60, 80 characters per line.  If "None" is selected, then a linefeed
 character will only be sent to the printer between the message and the
 time stamp.  A linefeed is sent to the printer at the end of the message,
 and on some models a linefeed is also sent before the message.
