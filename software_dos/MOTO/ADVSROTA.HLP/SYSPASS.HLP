 System Password

 This is a 6 character alphanumeric password used by automatic remote
 entry devices when communicating to a paging terminal. Depending on
 the requirements of the paging terminal, a system password or caller
 id might be required before allowing automatic remote entry of
 messages. If this is the case, you must enter the system password
 in this data entry area. If no system password is required, leave this
 entry area blank.
