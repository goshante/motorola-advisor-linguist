 Numeric Beep On Bad Data

 With this option selected, when the pager detects an error in the incoming
 message, the message is stored and the pager alerts as usual.  When the
 message is read the errored characters are displayed between special
 "error string delimeter" characters.

 If this option is not selected, when the pager detects an error in the
 incoming message, the pager discards the entire message and does not
 alert.
