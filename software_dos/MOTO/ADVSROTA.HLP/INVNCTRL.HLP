 Inventory Control Number

 The Inventory Control Number is an identification number which you assign
 to the pager. This number is stored in the pager. Unlike the Serial Number
 of the pager, this number can be changed as per your needs. It is also
 important to note that the data entered in this field is used to create
 the filename of the archive file for this pager. Therefore, it is
 important to enter a unique Inventory Control Number for each pager if
 you are saving each pager configuration to disk.
