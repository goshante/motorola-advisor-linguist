 Enable/Disable a Pager

 Enable a pager will return a pager to operable service. After a pager
 is enabled, it resumes normal operation and can receive and display
 pages.

 Disable a pager removes a pager from operable service. While disabled,
 a pager will still receive but won't display pages.
