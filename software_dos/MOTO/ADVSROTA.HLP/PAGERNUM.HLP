 Pager Number

 The Pager Number is the number you would ordinarily enter while using a
 page entry device. When entering a page from the telephone keypad, many
 systems allow you to enter an abbreviated pager number than ordinarily
 would be entered when using a page entry terminal. You must enter the
 pager number in the format that your automatic alphanumeric page entry
 port will accept.
