  When a message is being received, an envelope will appear on the display.
  If the incoming message is not a priority page, then after it has been
  completely received, the pager will revert back to the last screen shown
  before the message was received.  If the message is a priority page, then
  the pager will revert to the status screen.

  If this option is not selected, the pager will always revert to the status
  screen.
