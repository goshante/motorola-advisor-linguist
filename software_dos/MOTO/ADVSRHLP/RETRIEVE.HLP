  The Retrieve a stored pager screen allows you to enter the Inventory
  Control Number of a pager configuration which you have previously saved
  to disk. The Inventory Control Number may be an actual inventory control
  number of a pager or it may be a name of a template file used to identify
  one of the common types of pagers you program.
