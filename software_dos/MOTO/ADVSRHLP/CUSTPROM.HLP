
  Custom Prompts

  This screen allows you to customize your prompts.  You can only
  get to this screen by selecting "Custom" for the INTERNATIONAL PROMPTS
  option.  The language selected for the prompts is determined by the
  last language selected prior to selection "Custom" INTERNATIONAL PROMPTS.
  That is, if you had previously selected "Russian" prompts then went back
  to "Custom" prompts, you would see Russian prompts on this screen.
