  SERIAL number

  The Serial Number of the pager is an identifying number which should never
  change throughout the life of the pager. This number is normally
  programmed into the pager at the factory. This number should also be
  located on one of the labels attached to the pager. If this label is not
  available, refer to the order form for the appropriate serial number.
