 Motorola would like to inform  you of an  inconsistent operation  with  the
 "Duplicate Message Detection" Option on the BRAVO Alphanumeric POCSAG pager
 ( Model Number suffix AA).  In  order to  minimize any inconvenience to you
 and your customers,  Motorola would  like you to be aware of this issue and
 the necessary actions that are being taken to overcome it.

 This problem is only exhibited in POCSAG BRAVO Alphanumeric pagers that are
 programmed with one of the  "Duplicate Message Detection"  options.  When a
 specific  set of  circumstances  occur,  affected pagers  may replace  data
 messages with a "Tone Only" message screen. This may occur when a data page
 is received,  immediately deleted,  and the pager then receives a Tone Only
 page on the same function.

                                                  <Page Down>    <Page Up> 

 Pagers will function correctly if  1) all messages received contain Numeric
 or Alphanumeric data or  2) Tone Only pages are on a seperate function.

 In order to prevent this problem from occuring in pagers that are currently
 in service, Motorola advises you of the following options, any one of which
 will alleviate the situation:


 1) The  'Duplicate Message Detection' option can be programmed out with the
 BRAVO  Alphanumeric  Programming  Software  Package.    This  will  totally
 eliminate any inconsistent operation.


                                                  <Page Down>    <Page Up> 
.p

 2) The user could be advised to 'DELETE' any Tone Only pages as soon as they
 are received.  This will ensure that the memory management function operates
 correctly.  Any duplicate Numeric or Alphanumeric messages will be correctly
 indicated  and  no data messages will be misinterpreted by the pager as Tone
 Only.

 These above suggestions will allow the User to continue to use the pager and
 receive pages in the appropriate manner.

 For those customers who do not find the above  options acceptable,  Motorola
 will be happy to arrange to have  these units retrofitted with a new Decoder
 board through the National Warranty Depots until December 31, 1990.   Normal
 warranty procedures will be in effect for all other claims.


 All Motorola Sales Representatives have been  informed of this issue and the
 alternatives  proposed  above.  If you have  any  further  questions  please
 contact your Motorola Sales Representative or  Eric Dilley of Paging Product
 Services in Boynton Beach Florida. ( Telephone 407-364-2206 )

 today in our factory. These units  are defined  by the  Model  Number Suffix
 "BA".  Future  upissues will be advised  through normal  channels.  Motorola

 issue is dealt with quickly and efficiently.  This inconsistent operation is
 is not found in any other Pager supplied by Motorola.
