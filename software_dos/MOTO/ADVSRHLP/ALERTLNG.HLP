
  Alert Length

  This option allows you to select the amount of time an alert will
  continue when an incoming page is received. This gives you the flexibility
  of choosing an extremely short alert of 2 seconds or longer alerts up to
  12 seconds. You may also select to have the pager continuously alert until
  the alert is manually reset by pressing one of the buttons on the pager.
