
    Disable On/Off Switch

    This option enables the user to disable the on/off switch.
    Some countries require that the pager not be able to be turned
    off.  Choosing "YES" will change the pager to an "always on"
    state, and can only be turned off by removing the battery.

    NOTE:  If this options is selected, the pager will chirp and/or
    vibrate when the ON/OFF button is pressed to provide positive
    indication that the pager is operational.
