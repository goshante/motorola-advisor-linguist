
  Reminder Chirp in MEM

  Choosing this option causes the pager to remind you when there are unread
  pages in memory. A chirp will sound every 2 minutes in the 'MEM-O-LERT'
  position if there are unread pages. The reminder alert will accelerate to
  every 15 seconds when the pager's memory is full of unread messages.
