
  Low Battery Alert

  This option indicates which type of alert will sound when a
  low battery condition is detected.

  If "Voice" is selected, a voice prompt for "Low Battery Alert"
  must be programmed in the pager. If no voice prompt is programmed,
  this option will revert to "Tone".
