
  Alpha Beep On Bad Data

  With this option selected, when the pager detects an error in the incoming
  message, the message is stored and the pager alerts as usual.  When the
  message is read the errored characters will be displayed between special
  non-printable "error string delimiter" characters.

  If this option is not selected, when the pager detects an error in the
  incoming message, the pager discards the entire message and does not
  alert.
