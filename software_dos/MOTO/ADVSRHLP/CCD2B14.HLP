
  14 Bit Decoding Method

  There are two decoding methods Advisor CCD supports:
        1. 2-Byte Method
        2. 14-Bit Method

  It requires 2 ASCII bytes to represent a Chinese character say High Byte
  and Low Byte.

  For a 2-Byte Method, the Advisor CCD decodes High Byte first then Low 
  Byte. For a 14-Bit Method, the Advisor CCD decodes reversely, i.e. Low 
  Byte first then High Byte.
