
  Out of Range Alert

  This option indicates which type of alert will sound when an
  out of range condition is detected.

  If "Voice" is selected, a voice prompt for "Out of Range Alert"
  must be programmed in the pager. If no voice prompt is programmed,
  this option will revert to "Tone".
