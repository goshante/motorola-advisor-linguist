
  Unread Message Alert Time

  The unread message indicator causes the LED to periodically flash 
  until the message has been read. This serves as a reminder that an 
  unread message exists.

  This option specifies the period of time between reminders.  Valid
  selections are 'none', 30 seconds, 60 seconds, 2 minutes, and 5 minutes. 
  The default setting is 2 minutes. If 'none' is selected, there will
  be no unread message indicator.
